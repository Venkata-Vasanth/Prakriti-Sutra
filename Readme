Prakriti Sutra: Personalized Ayurvedic Wellness Portal

🌟 Project Overview

Prakriti Sutra (The Principles of Your Constitution) is a modern web application designed for college wellness initiatives to help users discover their unique Dosha (body constitution, or Prakriti). It provides a full user journey, from initial sign-up to personalized daily recommendations and real-time AI guidance.

The application is built using a pure JavaScript (Frontend-Only) architecture for rapid deployment and ease of demonstration, leveraging local browser storage for session management and relying on the Google Gemini API for its intelligent assistant.

✨ Key Features

Guided Onboarding: Simulates a user flow with a Landing Page and an Authentication screen (Sign Up/In).

Dosha Quiz (The Core): A structured 12-question quiz based on Ayurvedic principles to determine the user's dominant Dosha (Vata, Pitta, or Kapha).

Personalized Dashboard: Displays the user's calculated Dosha, along with tailored recommendations for Diet, Lifestyle, and Stress Management. Markdown formatting is rendered correctly for emphasis.

Sattva Guide (AI Assistant): A persistent, floating chat widget powered by the Gemini API. The assistant is context-aware, receiving the user's specific Dosha result to provide personalized, real-time wellness advice.
